	[CAPPUCCINO EDITOR FRAMEWORK > Core > Icons]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Some of Unity Engine's core icons aren't available to Cappuccino, despite trying to retrieve them through EditorGUIUtility.FindTexture(). As a result, some commonly
	desired icons have been created to replace those unattainable icons. This does unfortunately increase the filesize of the editor window drastically. Until such a time
	when the Unity Icons are available directly and without hassle, these icons will be bundled with the editor framework.

	Anything in this folder may be used by editor framework utilities and classes until the unity variations are made available. Do not delete this folder in any current
	or future iterations of Cappuccino Editor Framework until it is greenlit otherwise.
