The scripts in this folder are specific to the Visual Scripting & Graph Window.
These require the release of USS Object Model specific to Cappuccino Editor Framework, not the one on GitHub.

The reason to have a folder specific to USSOM scripts is so that it's easier to find and modify specific styles for sheets in C#.
If you prefer directly modifying the Unity Style Sheets see: GraphWindow > Style Sheets > Generic Fields
